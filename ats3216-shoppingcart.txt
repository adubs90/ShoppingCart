Assignment Overview

This assignment was to enable us to remember what we had learned (or at least what I had learned) in TCSS 143.
It covered many of the same topics such as lists, ArrayLists, Iterators, toString(), equals(), and other basic
programming algorithms. We completed the "back end" section of this shopping cart program so that the already 
written "front end" would function properly. While rehashing a lot of what I had previously learned in TCSS143,
this assignment also showed how useful the tools can be in debugging your code. I also learned what the 
hashCode() method was, as well as StringBuilder.


Technical Impression

This assignment, while at first seemed very difficult to me, actually ended up being fairly simple. Of course, 
there were some minor hiccups along the way, but that comes with any given project. First off, I thought it was
really cool that we were actually using a GUI to display the code that we had written. Even if we didn't program
it, I thought it was a neat way of displaying our "back end" part of the code. By far, the most difficult sections
of this assignment were the priceFor(), equals(), add(), and getTotal() methods. They had the most difficult 
coding aspects, as well as some semi-tricky algorithms to figure out. All in all though, it was not too bad. 
I did however end up not being able to get rid of two bugs in my program. They don't seem to hamper the output,
but they are still annoying nonetheless. These bugs are:

"Equals method for Item asumes the argument is of type Item."
"Item.equals(Object) does not check for null argument"

I'm not necessarily sure what the first bug means, for I thought I was fairly deliberate in my assignment.
I did however try to fix the second bug by checking for a null argument, but I still couldn't get it to 
go away in the end.
